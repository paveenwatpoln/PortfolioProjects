# Global COVID 19 Data Analysis using SQL

This project analyzes COVID-19 pandemic data using SQL queries to gain insights and answer key questions. The dataset includes cases, deaths, population, and vaccination information across locations and continents.

We utilize various SQL techniques like joins, CTEs, temporary tables, window functions, and aggregations to extract valuable information. Additionally, we create views to store analysis results for further exploration, visualization, and reporting.

The analyses include:

1. **Mortality Rate:** Compares deaths to total cases to understand the severity by location/continent.
2. **Infection Rate:** Calculates the percentage of a population infected to assess spread across regions.
3. **Hotspots:** Identifies countries with the highest infection and death rates relative to population.
4. **Death Impact:** Determines the countries and continents with the highest total death counts.
5. **Global Trends:** Tracks daily global cases, deaths, and death rate to understand the pandemic's severity over time.
6. **Vaccination Progress:** Calculates the cumulative vaccination count, tracks vaccinated population percentage, and presents it alongside total population. 

This project provides a foundation for further data exploration and visualization to gain a deeper understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic.
